ILBM PCHG
===

The format itself is described
[here](https://github.com/sabberworm/node-iff-parser/blob/master/doc/IFF_FORMS/ILBM/ILBM_PCHG.txt).

To convert an image to format suitable to display with `showpchg`, you have to
use HamLabPlus Amiga software. Choose HAM6 and PCHG with up to 15 colors.
